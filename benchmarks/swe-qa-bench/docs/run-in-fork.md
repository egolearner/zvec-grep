# Run the Rust SWE-QA benchmark in your fork

The [SWE-QA workflow](../../../.github/workflows/swe-qa-bench.yml) compares OpenCode without and with the **same selected Rust zvec-grep build**. It never benchmarks the TypeScript package checked out with the harness. `candidate_ref` may be a Rust branch, tag, or commit; it defaults to `main`. The workflow records the resolved commit and verifies the npm tarball hash before each task. The benchmark is manual-only and runs only for a fork's `admin` or `maintain` members, including job reruns.

1. Fork `zvec-ai/zvec-grep` and clone your fork. Enable GitHub Actions in the fork. Put this workflow on the fork's **default branch** first: GitHub's manual dispatch control requires the workflow file to exist there. You may then use `--ref` to choose a different harness branch. Set `candidate_ref` independently to choose the Rust source to build. The chosen ref must exist in the fork and contain `rust/`.
2. Obtain a Bailian API key for a workspace that can invoke the selected `glm-5.2` or `qwen3.8-max` model. In your fork's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**, add the repository secret `GLM_API_KEY`. Both model choices use this legacy secret name for execution and self-judging. Do not commit the key or pass it on a command line. With [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_secret_set), run `gh secret set GLM_API_KEY --repo OWNER/zvec-grep` and enter the value interactively.
3. In the same Actions settings, add the repository **variable** `SWE_QA_MODEL_BASE_URL`, for example `https://YOUR-WORKSPACE.cn-beijing.maas.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1`. Use the OpenAI-compatible URL for **your** Bailian workspace and the region of your API key. The variable is applied to both execution and judging. If omitted, the workflow retains the project maintainer's checked-in endpoint, which may not accept your key.
4. The default `embedding=local` uses `local/potion-code-16m-v2` and needs no embedding credential. For `embedding=remote`, add the repository secret `QWEN_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` and repository variable `QWEN_EMBEDDING_ENDPOINT`; the workflow uses `qwen/qwen3.7-text-embedding`, as Retrieval-only does. Source content is sent to that endpoint in remote mode.
5. Open **Actions → SWE-QA Bench → Run workflow**, choose the harness branch, then set `candidate_ref`, `model`, `embedding`, and `scope`. Start with `repro-3` (3 tasks × 2 profiles × 5 trials = 30 trials). `smoke` has 5 tasks / 50 trials; `all-full` has 20 tasks / 200 trials. Failed trials can be retried twice, causing additional model calls. Both execution and judging use the selected model. The default model is `glm-5.2`.

Equivalent CLI dispatch:

```sh
gh workflow run swe-qa-bench.yml --repo OWNER/zvec-grep \
  --ref main \
  -f candidate_ref=main \
  -f model=glm-5.2 \
  -f embedding=local \
  -f scope=repro-3
```

Use your fork's Rust branch name or full commit SHA for `candidate_ref` when evaluating a change. `--ref` selects the **benchmark harness**; `candidate_ref` selects the **Rust package**. The workflow does not run from a pull request or push, and it does not use upstream CI resources. A GitHub user with only `write` access may see the dispatch button, but the workflow rejects the run before checkout or model-secret use.

The versioned [`ci-config.json`](../ci-config.json) sets the trial count, failure retry limit, and model behind each embedding runtime. Change that file on the harness branch to change the fixed protocol; the workflow input selects one of those versioned runtimes, while environment variables carry endpoints and credentials.

The run Summary shows the selected Rust commit and the aggregate of completed task reports. Download the `swe-qa-aggregate-report-*` artifact for `report.md`, `report.json`, and `candidate-manifest.json` (commit and tarball hash); individual task reports are retained for 90 days. Paired Harbor evidence, including failed attempts under `.retry-history/`, is retained for 30 days. If tasks fail, they are listed as missing and excluded from every Aggregate metric; the workflow still has a failed conclusion.
