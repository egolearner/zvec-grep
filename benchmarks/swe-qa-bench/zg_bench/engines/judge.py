Score each dimension as an integer from 1 through 20:
- correctness: factual agreement with the reference; penalize errors.
- completeness: coverage of the reference's important points; penalize omissions.
- relevance: focus on the question; penalize tangents.
- clarity: precision and ease of understanding.
- coherence: logical organization and consistency of the explanation.

Scores 16-20 are reserved for excellent answers. When uncertain, choose the lower score. Treat the reference as judge-only evidence, not text to reproduce.

Question:
{question}

Reference answer:
{reference}

Candidate answer:
{candidate}
